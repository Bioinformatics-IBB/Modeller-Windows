# Welcome to the Project's wiki!


### Here we are implementing Automation, clustering of codes, redefining functions of Modeller‚Ñ¢(Salilab's) for Windows.üòä 
***
## **A project for our own understanding of Modeller‚Ñ¢ as well as bioinformatics.**

**The scope of project is to Develop and maintain GST, CYP4, CYP6 based automation tools, So that it will be helpful in further different projects related to our core thesis. Hence following are the checkpoints based on their timeline:-**
* Establishment of Environment.
* Development of Automation scripts.
* Alteration of predefined codes as per our project.
* Providing User-friendliness.
* Development of GUI tool.
* Generate Ramchandran Plot and Dope score.

whole tool is based on Pythonüêç and Modeller‚Ñ¢ scripts. Which includes PIR, FASTA, ALI files. Which have Genomic data. Modeller‚Ñ¢ provides processing libraries.
